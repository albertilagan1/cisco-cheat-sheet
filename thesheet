!!Configuring a Switch to give ip address (DHCP)
config t
vlan m
name m
exit
ip dhcp excluded-add (IP range)
ip dhcp pool vlanm (no space)
network (ip and subnet)
default-router m
domain-name m
dns-server 8.8.8.8
option 150 ip 1.1.1.1

!!Make Sure the Device int Interface is conneced to the vlan to get IP
conf t
int em/m
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan m
do sh vlan brief

!!Now on the Device That Wants the IP from the Created DHCP
config t
int em/m
ip add dhcp
no shut
do sh ip int brief | ex una

!!How to Setup a NTP Server on a Cisco 
!!Make sure to remove existing ntp server (check commands)
sh ntp status
sh ntp associations

!!remove commands
no ntp server (m)
no ntp master (1)

Router
clock set HH:MM:SS MONTH DAY YEAR
config t
ntp server (m)
ntp master (strautum-level(3))
end

!!Other Router Resquesting Time From NTP Server
!!Make sure there's a route if it's in another network
config t
ntp server (ip address of NTP Server)

!!static route for next hop
!!Better to static route to the network, check the slash so you can do the correct subent mask, ending 0 ip is a network

config t
ip route (destinationIP, subent mask, next hop)

!!if device is projecting wrobg time despite correct ntp associations then try this
debug ntp packets
undebug ntp packets

!!how to enable ssh
config t
IP domain-name m.com
crypto key generate rsa
m (2048)
aaa new-model
username m privilege 15 secret m
aaa authentication login default local
line vty 0 4
transport input ssh
login authentication default
exit
IP ssh version 2
IP ssh-timeout 60
IP ssh authentication-retries 3
exit

!!how to connect to ssh externally 
ssh -l (username) (ip)

!!how to create loopbacks manually
config t
int loopback m
IP add m (subnet mask m)
!!so what are loopbacks for?
!!it can be used as a constant connection 

!!how to configure NAT on a Cisco router
config t
IP access-list standard m
permit m
permit m
exit
!!declare what is inside (the IP's that will be converted)
int (desired cable) m
IP nat inside
exit
!!declare where it will be going 
int (desired cable) m
IP nat outside 
exit
IP nat inside source list (access list standard name) interface (outside cable) overload
!!so the overload means change all IP's from the inside to the outbound interface cable's ip
